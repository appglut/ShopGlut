= How do I set up product swatches for my variations? =
Navigate to ShopGlut → Product Swatches to enable and configure swatches globally. For specific attributes, go to Products → Attributes, edit your attribute, and choose the swatch type (color, image, label, or bicolor).

= Can I display swatches on shop and category pages? =

= What swatch types are supported? =
ShopGlut supports four swatch types: Color swatches (solid colors), Image swatches (thumbnail images), Bicolor swatches (dual-color gradients), and Label swatches (text-based). You can mix different swatch types for different attributes on the same product.

= Can I customize the appearance of swatches? =
Absolutely! Control swatch dimensions, shapes (circle, square, rounded, custom), border styles, colors, and hover effects. Configure tooltips, typography, spacing, and positioning. Each attribute can have its own custom settings, and you can override global settings for individual products.

Navigate to ShopGlut → Layouts → Comparison in your admin dashboard. Create a new comparison layout and customize the comparison table styling, fields, and display options.

By default, customers can compare up to 4 products simultaneously for optimal viewing. The comparison table is fully responsive and automatically adjusts to different screen sizes to ensure a great experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

= Can I have different comparison layouts for different pages? =
Yes! You can create multiple comparison layouts and assign them to specific locations like the main shop page, individual product categories, or product tags. Only one layout can be active per location, and the system prevents conflicts by showing which locations are already taken by other layouts.

= How do I add product badges to my products? =
Navigate to ShopGlut → Product Badges to enable and configure custom product labels. Create badges for sales, new products, featured items, out-of-stock status, and more. You can customize badge colors, shapes, positions, and animations. Badges can be applied globally to all products or individually to specific products based on categories, tags, or custom conditions.

= Can I create custom fields for my products? =
Yes! Go to ShopGlut → Product Custom Fields to add custom fields to your products. Choose from various field types including text, textarea, number, date, select, checkbox, and more.

= How do I use the Shortcode Showcase module? =
Navigate to ShopGlut → Shortcode Showcase in your admin dashboard.

The module provides live preview functionality, detailed parameter explanations, and copy-to-clipboard features for easy implementation.

= What shortcodes are available in the Shortcode Showcase module? =
The primary shortcode is [shopglut_woo_category] which allows you to display products from specific WooCommerce categories. You can customize columns, pagination, sorting, filtering, and use custom Woo Templates for unique product displays. Additional shortcodes include [shopglut_archive] for latest products and [shopglut_product_table] for tabular product displays.

= Can I customize the appearance of shortcode output? =
Absolutely! The Shortcode Showcase module integrates seamlessly with Woo Templates, allowing you to create custom product display templates. You can control grid layouts, colors, typography, spacing, and all visual aspects. The module also includes built-in toolbar options for search, filtering, and sorting with customizable styling.
